The Ali Baba Cave Analogy

    Imagine a ring-shaped cave with a magic door separating two paths, A and B.

The Prover knows the secret word to open the magic door, but The Verifier does
not.

The Verifier waits outside as the Prover enters the cave and chooses path A or B
at random.

After the Prover has entered, the Verifier calls out which path the Prover
should return from (A or B).

If the Prover truly knows the secret word, she can always comply—using the
secret word to unlock the door if needed and return via the Verifier’s chosen
path.

If the Prover does not know the secret, she cannot guarantee she will be able to
return via the randomly chosen path unless she guesses correctly.

By repeating the process many times (with the Verifier choosing randomly each
time), the chance that the Prover is merely guessing diminishes rapidly. If the
Prover succeeds every time, the Verifier is convinced the Prover knows the
secret.

Yet, the Verifier learns absolutely nothing about the secret itself—only that
the Prover knows it.
