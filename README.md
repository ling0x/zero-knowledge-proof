The Ali Baba Cave Analogy

    Imagine a ring-shaped cave with a magic door separating two paths, A and B.

Peggy (the prover) knows the secret word to open the magic door, but Victor (the
verifier) does not.

Victor waits outside as Peggy enters the cave and chooses path A or B at random.

After Peggy has entered, Victor calls out which path Peggy should return from (A
or B).

If Peggy truly knows the secret word, she can always comply—using the secret
word to unlock the door if needed and return via Victor’s chosen path.

If Peggy does not know the secret, she cannot guarantee she will be able to
return via the randomly chosen path unless she guesses correctly.

By repeating the process many times (with Victor choosing randomly each time),
the chance that Peggy is merely guessing diminishes rapidly. If Peggy succeeds
every time, Victor is convinced Peggy knows the secret.

Yet, Victor learns absolutely nothing about the secret itself—only that Peggy
knows it.
